# Dogaku
This Python application is used to learn two of the three Japanese language syllabaries in a gamified way. These two syllabaries, hiragana and katakana, make up the foundation of the Japanese language and are the starting point for every new learner.

## Features
- LEARN: Teaches the two Japanese syllabaries by displaying mnemonics and providing audio files of pronounciation from a native speaker.
- PRACTICE: Quizzes the user on the 92 characters in the Japanese syllabaries. Provides statistics to track improvement and efficiency.
- SPRINT: Challenges the user to complete all 92 characters as quickly and accurately as possible. Try and beat your previous record!
- TIME TRIAL: Challenges the user to complete all 92 characters in a set amount of time. Mistakes cost you time in this challenge.
